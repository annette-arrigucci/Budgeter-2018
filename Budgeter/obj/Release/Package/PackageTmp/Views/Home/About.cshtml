<h2>Budgeter FAQs</h2>

<p>
    <b>What is Budgeter?</b><br>
    Budgeter allows you and members of your household to create monthly budgets and compare them against income and expense transactions in your accounts. Budgeter was developed by Annette Arrigucci for Coder Foundry in 2016.</p> 
    
    <p>The application was implemented with ASP.NET MVC and C# with JavaScript, JQuery and AJAX. The dashboard charts are created with morris.js.</p>
</p>

<p>
    <b>What is a household?</b><br>
    Households are a group of accounts and users. Each user belongs to only one household, but the household can have many users. Each user in your household has full access to all account data. When a user leaves a household, he or she no longer has access to any of the household’s accounts.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Who can invite new users to a household?</b><br>
    Any user in the household can invite a new member to join via an email invitation form. However, it’s important that you trust any individuals you invite as all users in a household have the same level of access to account information.
</p>

<p>
    <b>How do I set up a budget?</b><br>
    Click on the "View Budgets" link under the Budget menu in the left menu. Here you can access previously created budgets and create new budgets for each month. You can create future budgets up to a year in the future. Use the "Add Income/Expense" form to add a budget item under the household’s predefined categories. Budget items can be for that month only or set to repeat every month.
</p>

<p>
    <b>What categories are included when creating a household budget items and transaction? Can I add or remove categories from the budget?</b><br>
    Thirteen categories are included by default in the household's budget/transaction categories. Users can go to the "Edit Categories" link under the Budget menu to delete categories or add new ones.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Can I add more than one account in my household?</b><br>
    Yes, you can add multiple checking or savings accounts for one household.
</p>

<p>
    <b>What is a reconciled amount?</b><br>
    The reconciled amount on a transaction is the actual amount a user has spent/earned on a transaction as verified by a source such as a receipt or bank statement. It is up to the user to edit a transaction to enter the reconciled amount once he or she knows it. The reconciled balance is calculated based on the totals of the reconciled amounts on each transaction.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Can I delete an account?</b><br>
    Yes, but all deleted accounts can be accessed again via the Deleted Accounts link on the main Accounts Index page.
</p>

<p>
    <b>What are my options for deleting transactions?</b><br>
    A transaction can be voided, which shows the transaction information on the Voided Transactions page but doesn’t include it in the household’s budget or account balance totals, or deleted, which removes it completely from the database.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Can I remove a recurring budget item?</b><br>
    Yes, click on the option to delete the budget item and you can select the option to remove the item from the current budget and all future budgets. The item will not be removed from past budgets.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Can I automatically connect my bank accounts to the Budgeter application?</b><br>
    No, not at this time. It is up to the user to accurately enter income and expense transactions.
